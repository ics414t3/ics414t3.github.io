## Overview
The ICS department is in need of an office space management system. Currently, there is no management system, which makes it difficult to reassign offices or assess rooms' inventory.

## Goals
Our goal is to develop a user friendly application that can assist the entire ICS department with distribution of key information and management.

## What Our Application Provides
This application will mainly provide the ICS Department's administrative office and tech support with an inventory and office space management system. Additionally, students and faculty also have access to the site, but with a different scope. Faculty can book conference rooms, and can update their office hours. Students on the other hand can look up faculty members, or locate where a certain room may be.
